### How to run

	Platform:	Mac OS X / Linux
	Language:	Python 2.7

Download the source code and `cd` into the `Minet` directory. The program dependent on `pyqt`, you should have installed pyqt first.

	pip install PyQt4

This command works for some users. I wish you can install pyqt through this command or you will have to find another way to install pyqt.

--------------

Now you can setup the server first:
	
	python server.py

Then you can create a users:

	python qtUI.py

If you want to create one more user, you just need to run the `python qtUI.py` command again in a new terminal.


Thank you.
